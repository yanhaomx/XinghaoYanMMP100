        I love to use sounds to make up a story.
        It starts with outdoor noise. You can hear traffic sounds and complex noise. 
        Then someone is off a car. The person is wearing a pair of high heel shoes stepping in a building hall. 
        Then she stops in the front of an elevator. The elevator goes up She hums a melody. 
        Then the sound of keys and opening door means she is home.

        I simply used five colors to deliver the idea. There are the colors which make people happy and feel comfortable. 
        I practiced the basic technics on After Effects, like moving, rotating, and transforming. 
        I also practiced the some of the 12 principles of making an animation, like timing, slow in and slow out, and exaggeration. 
        At the end, I added an idea of the button to make the picture looks like more three-dimensional and someone clicks the button.

        There was an Andy Warhol's exhibition at Whitney Museum early this year. I went to watch and started being interested in his works. 
        His subject are simple, yet his idea is a genius. I present four of his paintings in my video to show the idea that art is not far from real life 
        and art is for all of the people. 
        I utilize colors and shapes and edit them together in a cohesive way with music and highly dynamic style. I wish I deliver the spirit of art, pop and 
        modern with the short video can motivate the audience. 
        Technically, I use Photoshop to create each picture as frame, and I use After Effects to create a little bit short moving pictures. The sound of typing 
        keyboard is from Freesound.org. At end, I use Premiere to edit them together to create this stop-animation.
